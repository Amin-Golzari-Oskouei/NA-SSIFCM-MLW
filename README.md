# A Neighborhood-Aware Semi-Supervised Intuitionistic Fuzzy Clustering Method with Multi-Level Weighting 

This repository includes the MATLAB implementation of the NA-SSIFCM-MLW algorithm presented in:

Amin Golzari Oskouei, Negin Samadi, Asgarali Bouyer, and Bahman Arasteh, "TA Neighborhood-Aware Semi-Supervised Intuitionistic Fuzzy Clustering Method with Multi-Level Weighting," Applied Soft Computing (submitted).

Comments are written for all steps of the algorithm for better understanding the code. Also, a demo is implemented for ease of running, which runs by importing the data and other necessary algorithm parameters.
